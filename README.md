# The Racket Gardener

### Statement
  
  The project we are doing involves an arduino, sensors, plants, plots, and databases. Our program will control an arduino microcontroller with a few sensors for temperature, light, soil moisture, and humidity. These sensors will keep track of not only if you need to water the plant, but also provide an in depth analysis on trends in water consumption of a particular plant type and age. Relation between the consumption of water and environmental variables will provide a better determination for how much water you can expect your plant to consume. Database entries can be made, containing information on the watering needs for certain types of plants in certain conditions.
  
### Analysis
Explain what approaches from class you will bring to bear on the project.

- Will you use data abstraction? How?
  Yes
  
- Will you use recursion? How?
  Yes. Reading sensors and writing/analyzing this information will be done in infinite loops.
  
- Will you use map/filter/reduce? How? 

- Will you use object-orientation? How?
  Yes. For certain arduino control features involving objects to represent external sensors and their associated pins/ pin functionality.
  Also for database interactivity, will need objects to represent the strings of plant/sensor information pulled from or put into database (using sqlite).
  
- Will you use functional approaches to processing your data? How?

- Will you use state-modification approaches? How? (If so, this should be encapsulated within objects. `set!` pretty much should only exist inside an object.)

- Will you build an expression evaluator, like we did in the symbolic differentatior and the metacircular evaluator?

- Will you use lazy evaluation approaches?

### External Technologies
You are encouraged to develop a project that connects to external systems. For example, this includes systems that:

- retrieve information or publish data to the web
- generate or process sound
- control robots or other physical systems
- interact with databases

We will be using arduino sensors to obtain data and store in a database for analysis.

### Data Sets or other Source Materials
If you will be working with existing data, where will you get those data from? (Dowload from a website? Access in a database? Create in a simulation you will build? ...)

How will you convert your data into a form usable for your project?  

If you are pulling data from somewhere, actually go download it and look at it before writing the proposal. Explain in some detail what your plan is for accomplishing the necessary processing.

If you are using some other starting materials, explain what they are. Basically: anything you plan to use that isn't code.

### Deliverable and Demonstration

 The live demo will likely be much less interactive and much more going through a demonstration/ example of how one may set up and begin the plant monitoring system. 

 The software/ hardware produced will be instantly applicative in anyones back yard. (If we also get to include a solenoid valve and hose, could extend it to irrigation system)


### Evaluation of Results
How will you know if you are successful? 
If you include some kind of _quantitative analysis,_ that would be good.

## Schedule

### First Milestone (Sun Apr 9)
Which portion of the work will be completed (and committed to Github) by this day? 

### Second Milestone (Sun Apr 16)
Which portion of the work will be completed (and committed to Github) by this day?  

### Public Presentation (Mon Apr 24, Wed Apr 26, or Fri Apr 28 [your date to be determined later])
What additionally will be completed before the public presentation?

## Group Responsibilities
Here each group member gets a section where they, as an individual, detail what they are responsible for in this project. Each group member writes their own Responsibility section. Include the milestones and final deliverable.

Please use Github properly: each individual must make the edits to this file representing their own section of work.
